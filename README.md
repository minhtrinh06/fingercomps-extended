# FingerComps+

**FingerComps+** is a fan-made web application that lets climbing competitors see each others scores more deeply. The site is live at: [https://fingercomps.plus](https://fingercomps.plus)

I built this app to complement the amazing [FingerComps](https://fingercomps.com/) product and enable learning and growth for all fellow competition climbers.

This repository is a fork of [latiosu/fingercomps-extended](https://github.com/latiosu/fingercomps-extended) that adds:

- Filtering pills for narrowing competitor results by location, score range, tops, photos, and set date.
- A what-if sandbox for adding theoretical tops and previewing score or rank changes without affecting real competition results.
